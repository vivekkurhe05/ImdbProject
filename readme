Solution:

I have written four test scripts

storeMovieTitlesInArrayList() - This method stores movie titles in an ArrayList object named movieTitleList.

storeMovieRatingsInArrayList() - This method stores movie ratings in an ArrayList object named movieRatingsList.

storeMovieYearsInArrayList() - This method stores movie release years in an ArrayList object named movieYearsList

After fetching data from website and storing into separate arrayLists, data containing arrays are stored into SQLite table
and at the same time output is displayed on the console.
